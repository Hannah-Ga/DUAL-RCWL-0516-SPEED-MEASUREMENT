# GFS-RADAR
This project includes the use of two **RCWL-0516** microwave-Radar modules, a **BLE HC-10**, [lcd name] and a **STM32 Nucleo L152RE** Microcontroller [But many differen Microcontroller can be used]. 
### Project
Two **RCWL-0516** Modules were placed on wodden Pillars aproximately 50cm away from Each other, facing upwards. If a Object, for example a Hand passes in close Proximity to those Sensors (around 5cm above them), movement will be detected and the Sensors sends a HIGH Signal
